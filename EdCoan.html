        <div class="container">
          <p>Edward Ignatius Coan is known throughout the powerlifting world as the greatest of all time, having set over 71 world records throughout his long career. He dominated powerlifting at its nascence, at a time when even few super heavy weights had totalled one ton across the three power lifts -- the squat, bench, and deadlift. Though his reputation was marred by failed drug tests, Ed Coan remains well-regarded as the GOAT with a total of 2504 pounds lifted.</p>

            <h3>Squat</h3>
            <p>The IPF squat requires the lifter to bend at the knees and lower the body until the hip joint is lower than the knee joint, and IPF standards are known to be the strictest of all the powerlifting federations. Lifters can be red-lighted for bouncing, moving the feet placement, and failure to lock knees out.</p>

            <h3>Bench Press</h3>
            <p>The IPF bench press requires the lifter to lower the bar to the chest, pause until the command is given, then press to full extension. Heaving the bar or any motion of the feet, shoulders, head, or buttocks rising off the bench will result in a red light.</p>

            <h3>Deadlift</h3>
            <p>The IPF deadlift requires the lifter to pull the barbell from the floor to lockout, with hips, knees, and shoulders locked out. Shifting of the feet, downward travel of the bar, or hitching the bar up the thighs are also grounds for red lights from the referees.</p>
